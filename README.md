<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>
After you download and open the software first thing you want to do is choosing your workshop content from second page that named "Choose Directory". After then if you want to compress your content choose a output directory and press compress button. Otherwise if you just want to generate lua code then you know what button you have to press.
